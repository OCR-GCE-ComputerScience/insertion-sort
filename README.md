# insertion-sort

A main class with a psvm method has been created for you as a start.  There is also an example using a bubble sort.

Your task is to create a similar class to the bubble sort except it uses an insertion sort.  You will also need to extend the psvm method to create an instance of a new insertion object and display your results.

Extension: convert the public variable in bubble and insertion sort classes to private and use getters and setters.
